## 2. Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
All members will be expected to complete all deadlines given by leaders and the teacher on time, using any schedule that fits them best. All members are expected to communicate scheduling conflicts with leaders and resolve them. Members are expected to be courteous to others at all times.
## 3. Scheduling Meetings: 
The Team has agreed to meet every Sunday between 2:00 - 3:00 pm PST to discuss the following week’s work and current project progress. The meeting will take place on either Zoom or Slack Huddle. All members are expected to attend, however meeting is not mandatory. All other meetings will be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance and members are required to give notice if they are unable to attend. 
## 4. General Responsibilities for ALL Team Members:
During our work, our team desires to facilitate:
Psychological safety
Fast confirmation on how many people will be able to complete a particular task.
Efficient work completion - spread out as evenly as possible.
Accountability for work done
Amicable relations among team members

Communication: Members should communicate with leaders, teammates and the team as a whole whenever necessary and possible. Better communication makes a better team. All members should feel comfortable talking to each other, talk with team leads if they don’t. 

Members should be active in discussions and enjoy sharing and taking ideas and criticism even without anonymity.

All members should actively contribute to the creation of the project. Members should respond to scheduling inquiries as soon as possible, and meet deadlines set by team leaders with the intent of meeting deadlines set by the class.

##5 Conflict Resolution:
Resolving members missing deadlines: If a subteam does not meet a deadline set by leaders AND they don’t communicate the fact that they will not be able to finish it before the deadline, then they receive a deadline-strike. 2 missed WORK deadlines without any notice results in a discussion with team leads about any scheduling issues can be resolved. 4 work missed deadlines results in the team leads reporting the member to the TA.

Resolving Issues surrounding problematic team members: If leaders get consistent reports about a problematic team member and it appears that that team member is clearly disrespectful, or if there is a conflict between members, then those members will be called to a meeting to air their grievances, with the aim of finding a solution to them. If the issue continues or cannot be resolved, then said members will be reported to the TA.

Resolving Issues surrounding disagreement about Project path: If there are disagreements amongst the team about the direction of the project, whether in Slack or in person, Team Leads will schedule a meeting to bring the WHOLE team together to discuss the disagreement until a compromise/solution is reached.
