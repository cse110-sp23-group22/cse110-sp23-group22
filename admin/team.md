 ## Team Values 

We are a team focused on communication, trust and working together to create and complete cohesive projects. Through our work, we hope to not only better ourselves, but our teammates as well. We are committed to putting our all into our work. 

Our team desires to facilitate: 
- Psychological saftey amongst fellow members and peers.
- Efficient work completion - balanced distribution of tasks
- Accountability for work done
- Amicable relations amongst team members

As a team, members should be comfortable:
- Communicating with leaders, teammates and the group as a whole - better communication makes a better team. 
- Being active in discussion, sharing and taking ideas from others.
- Voicing concerns or criticism where they seem fit

We are focused not only on the end goal, but making the process to get there as smooth and thorough as possible. 


<h1><span style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', cursive;">Meet Our Team!</span></h1>

**Hi I'm Eric Chen**, my hobbies include video games, digital art, and game development. While I'm not exactly shy in terms of speaking, don't try ask me about any of my work as I'm shy about sharing the work I care about [I have high standards and I pretty much never meet them] (;-;). If anybody wants to talk about/play video games try to ask me about it, I play quite a lot more genres than most people.
