## Considered Options
* Horoscope
* Adding certain categories
* Add user authentication
* Palm reading
* Get more information on the user
* Tarot card

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: “Tarot card, Horoscope” because tarot cards can make the response more personalized and provide more specific information and horoscope is easier to design.
