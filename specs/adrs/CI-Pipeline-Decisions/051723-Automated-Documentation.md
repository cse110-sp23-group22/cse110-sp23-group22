# Automated Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

How to do documentation generation for our project?
Which documentation generator to choose?
How to apply it to our project?

## Considered Options

Which documentation generator to choose?
JSDocs
Docco
Doxx
YUIDoc


## Decision Outcome


Chosen option: “JSDocs”, because it is designed specifically for JavaScript and it has been adopted by many developers and organizations. Many IDEs like Visual Studio Code and WebStorm support JSDoc.


We can apply JSDocs to the project by downloading the “JSDoc” extension on VSCode.
